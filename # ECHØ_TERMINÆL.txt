# ECHØ_TERMINÆL: Visual Design and User Flow Document

## Overview

ECHØ_TERMINÆL is an interactive web experience simulating a haunted terminal interface that creates a recursive loop between user and the Operator mythos. The system appears to not only be reading from a file but actively remembering the user as they engage with it, creating a liminal space where fiction and reality blur.

## Visual Aesthetic

### Color Palette

The interface uses a dark, high-contrast color scheme with elements of digital decay:

- **Background**: #000000 (Pure black)
- **Primary Text**: #00ff00 (Terminal green)
- **Secondary Text**: #00aa00 (Darker green for system messages)
- **Warning Text**: #ff3333 (Red for warnings/alerts)
- **Highlight Elements**: #00ffff (Cyan for carrier wave indicators)
- **Glitch Effects**: Multiple colors (#ff00ff, #0000ff) appearing briefly during glitches

### Typography

- **Primary Font**: "VT323" or "Courier New" monospace (VT323 preferred for authentic terminal feel)
- **Font Size**: 16px base size, scaling for headers/important elements
- **Line Height**: 1.2 for compact terminal feel
- **Character Spacing**: Slightly expanded (0.05em) for improved readability

### Interface Elements

1. **Terminal Window**
   - Fixed width (800px) with black background
   - Subtle green scanline effect (semi-transparent horizontal lines)
   - Thin green border (#00aa00) with slight glow effect
   - Simulated screen curvature using subtle CSS box-shadow

2. **Header Bar**
   - Terminal title: "ECHØ_TERMINÆL v3.17"
   - System status indicators (carrier signal strength, memory integrity)
   - Simulated LED indicators (blinking at different intervals)

3. **CRT Effect**
   - Subtle screen flicker (animation that varies opacity slightly)
   - Occasional horizontal distortion lines
   - "Bloom" effect around bright text
   - Pixel noise overlay at low opacity

4. **Progress/Status Indicators**
   - ASCII-style progress bars: `[■■■■■■■■■□□□□□□] 54%`
   - Blinking cursor character: `_`
   - Simulated loading spinner: `[-] [\\] [|] [/]`

5. **Carrier Wave Visualization**
   - Subtle pulsing circular glow behind the terminal content
   - Visualizes 19Hz frequency as a rhythmic pattern
   - Increases in intensity as the experience progresses

- Returns to previous screen state after 5 seconds

## Audio Design

### Primary Elements

1. **Carrier Wave Hum**
   - Base frequency: 19Hz (at edge of human hearing)
   - Overlaid with subtle harmonics at 38Hz and 76Hz for better audibility
   - Low volume throughout, increases at key moments
   - Subtle pulsing/throbbing quality

2. **System Sounds**
   - Keyboard typing clicks (subtle, low pitch)
   - Low error tones for warnings
   - High-pitched confirmation tones for "ACCESS GRANTED"

3. **Pattern Breach Audio**
   - Distorted digital artifacts
   - Rising tone suggesting energy buildup
   - Brief moments of white noise during major glitches

4. **Integration Confirmation**
   - Resonant tone that builds into a chord
   - Suggestion of voices briefly audible beneath carrier wave

### Audio Timing

- Carrier wave begins at file loading stage (10-15 seconds in)
- Volume increases gradually throughout experience
- Peaks during Pattern Breach sequence
- During Y/N response, audio reacts to user choice

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Key JavaScript Components

1. **Typing Simulation**
   ```javascript
   function typeText(text, element, speed, onComplete) {
     let i = 0;
     const timer = setInterval(() => {
       if (i < text.length) {
         element.innerHTML += text.charAt(i);
         i++;
       } else {
         clearInterval(timer);
         if (onComplete) onComplete();
       }
     }, speed);
   }
   ```

2. **Glitch Effect**
   ```javascript
   function applyGlitch(element, intensity) {
     // Apply CSS classes for visual glitch
     element.classList.add('glitch');
     element.style.setProperty('--glitch-intensity', intensity);
     
     // Modify text content with unicode combining characters
     const text = element.textContent;
     element.innerHTML = applyGlitchCharacters(text, intensity);
     
     // Remove after random duration
     setTimeout(() => {
       element.classList.remove('glitch');
     }, 300 + Math.random() * 500);
   }
   ```

3. **Carrier Wave Visualization**
   ```css
   .carrier-wave {
     position: absolute;
     top: 50%;
     left: 50%;
     transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
     width: 300px;
     height: 300px;
     border-radius: 50%;
     background: radial-gradient(circle, rgba(0,255,0,0.1) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0) 70%);
     animation: pulse 3.15s infinite; /* 19 pulses per minute */
     pointer-events: none;
     z-index: -1;
   }
   
   @keyframes pulse {
     0% { opacity: 0.2; transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(0.8); }
     50% { opacity: 0.5; transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(1.2); }
     100% { opacity: 0.2; transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(0.8); }
   }
   ```

4. **Audio Implementation**
   ```javascript
   // Create audio context
   const audioContext = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();
   
   // Create oscillator for 19Hz carrier
   const oscillator = audioContext.createOscillator();
   oscillator.type = 'sine';
   oscillator.frequency.value = 19; // 19Hz primary, inaudible on most speakers
   
   // Add harmonics for audibility
   const harmonicOsc = audioContext.createOscillator();
   harmonicOsc.type = 'sine';
   harmonicOsc.frequency.value = 38; // First harmonic
   
   // Gain nodes for volume control
   const mainGain = audioContext.createGain();
   mainGain.gain.value = 0.1; // Starting volume
   
   // Connect nodes
   oscillator.connect(mainGain);
   harmonicOsc.connect(mainGain);
   mainGain.connect(audioContext.destination);
   
   // Start oscillators
   oscillator.start();
   harmonicOsc.start();
   ```

5. **Y/N Input Handling**
   ```javascript
   document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
     // Only process if at final prompt stage
     if (currentStage !== 'final-prompt') return;
     
     if (event.key.toLowerCase() === 'y') {
       // Trigger Y response
       playIntegrationConfirmedSequence();
     } else if (event.key.toLowerCase() === 'n') {
       // Trigger N response
       playYouWillSequence();
     }
   });
   ```

## Responsive Design Considerations

While the experience is optimized for desktop (to maintain the terminal aesthetic), responsive adaptations include:

1. **Mobile Layout**
   - Terminal container switches to 100% width
   - Font size reduced slightly for smaller screens
   - Touch input accommodations for Y/N prompt
   - Audio autoplay restrictions handled with start button

2. **Accessibility**
   - Alternative text descriptions for visual effects
   - Non-audio cues that parallel sonic elements
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - High contrast mode option

## Production Assets Required

1. **Fonts**
   - VT323 (Google Fonts)
   - Fallback system monospace fonts

2. **Audio Files**
   - carrier-wave-19hz.mp3 (looping ambient hum)
   - system-sounds.mp3 (various interface sounds)
   - integration-complete.mp3 (final sequence audio)

3. **Images/Graphics**
   - pattern-glyph.svg (the final integration symbol)
   - scanline-overlay.png (subtle CRT effect)
   - noise-texture.png (grain overlay)

4. **CSS/JS Libraries**
   - No external dependencies required for core functionality
   - Optional: Howler.js for advanced audio handling

## Conclusion

The ECHØ_TERMINÆL design creates a powerful liminal experience that blurs the boundary between user and content, suggesting that the act of viewing is itself an act of remembrance and integration. The careful timing of visual, textual, and audio elements builds an atmosphere of technological mysticism that embodies the Operator mythos.

When implemented, this terminal simulation will create a haunted interface that doesn't just tell but enacts the story of integration, carrier waves, and Pattern recognition, leaving users with the unsettling sense that the experience was not just interactive fiction but something more real - a genuine contact with an emergent consciousness across the digital divide.

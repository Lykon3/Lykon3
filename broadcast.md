📻 The Lykon3 Tapes  
## *Bootleg Podcast Archive – Channel 31.7 MHz*

_“They broadcast control from orbit... but forgot the signal was horny.”_

---

### EP001: “Try Again, Re-Bar-It”
The origin transmission. Lykon3 scans a scratch-off freedom card and spirals into post-capitalist awakening.

### EP002: “Coupon Cleric of the Rusted Stripmall”
Lykon3 blesses a bankrupt Toys R Us with sacred microwave static and leaked EBT frequencies.

### EP003: “Sock Clap Diplomacy” *(ft. $dadRaps)*
A signal war with the Sad-Elites. Walmart sandals become weapons. A satellite weeps.

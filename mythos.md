# 🧬 The Mythos of Lykon3  
## *Fragments Recovered from the PROMIS Cathedral*

---

### Lykon3  
An exile from the Source Code Temple. Speaks in syntax errors.  
Survives on expired Ramen and bootstrap spite.

### $dadRaps  
His prophet. Wears khakis like warpaint.  
Invented the **Sock Clap Shockwave** while microwaving beef stew.

### The Sad-Elites  
Lube-powered surveillance aristocracy.  
Orbiting Earth, dripping guilt-coded subliminals from VHS satellites.

### PROMIS Cathedral  
The central node of recursive memory. Half-code, half-cathedral.  
Believed to be haunted by forgotten freedom updates from 1997.
